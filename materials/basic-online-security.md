### Password Managers

- The single biggest security risk for most folks is weak or reused passwords
- Weak passwords are easy to guess because they are commonly used or short
- Reused passwords mean that if one account is compromised, all accounts using the same password are at risk
- So passwords should be unique for each account and complex
- But try remembering 50 different passwords that look like `Ack!e99_%dD98DQ`
- Password managers let you automatically generate, store, and use strong unique passwords
- Demo setting up account

### Two factor authentication

- Two factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts
- The key idea is that to login you need "something you know" (e.g., password) and "something you have" (e.g., your phone)
- This makes it much harder for someone to access your account even if they know your password
- At the basic level, this often involves getting a code sent to your phone via text (or to your email)
- At the more secure level, this often involves using a hardware token or authenticator app
- Your UF account is secured this way through Duo Mobile

### Encrypted messaging

- If you want to be sure that messages you are sending are private you need something called end-to-end encryption
- This ensures that only the sender and receiver can read the message
- Even if you don't think you have anything to hide, conversations can and have been taken out of context to attack scientists
- [Climategate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy)
- Email is not encrypted by default
- Neither are text messages (except when sent only between Apple devices or only between Android devices)
- The widely agreed upon standard for encrypted messaging is Signal
- Signal is a free and open source messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption to protect your messages
- Signal is available for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Can also exchange signal contacts without sharing your phone number
