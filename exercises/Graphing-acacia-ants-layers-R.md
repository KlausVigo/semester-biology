An experiment in Kenya has been exploring the influence of large herbivores on plants.

Check to see if `ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt` is in your workspace.
If not, [download it](https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/064/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt).
Read it into R using the following command:

```r
acacia <- read_tsv("data/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt", na = c("dead"))
```
1. Make a scatter plot with `CIRC` on the x axis and `AXIS1` (the maximum canopy
   width) on the y axis.
   Add a simple model of the data by adding `geom_smooth`.
   Label the x axis "Circumference" and the y axis "Canopy
   Diameter".

2. The same plot as (1), but use a linear model (`method = "lm"`) and show different species of ant (values of `ANT`) in separate subplots. Once this works, you can, as an **optional challenge**, try to automatically only plot subplots (i.e., ant species) with at least 5 data points. Note: results are shown for the basic exercise, not the optional challenge.

3\. Make a plot that shows histograms of both `AXIS1` and `AXIS2`. Due to the way
   the data is structured you’ll need to add a 2nd geom_histogram() layer that
   specifies a new aesthetic. To make it possible to see both sets of bars
   you’ll need to make them transparent with the optional argument alpha = 0.3.
   Set the color for `AXIS1` to "red" and `AXIS2` to "black" using the `fill`
   argument. Label the x axis "Canopy Diameter(m)" and the y axis "Number of Acacia".

4\. Use `facet_wrap()` to make the same plot as (3) but with one subplot for each
   treatment. Set the number of bins in the histogram to 10.

5\. Make a **non-stacked** histogram of the height of acacia (using the `HEIGHT` column) colored by the `TREATMENT`.
   Set the transparency (using `alpha`) to 0.5 so that you can see all of the bars.
   Label the x-axis "Heigth (m)" and the y-axis "Count of Acacia".
   Set the binwidth to 0.5.
