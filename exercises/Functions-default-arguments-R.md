The following function estimates the mass of an organism in kg based on its
length in meters and a set of parameter values. For some types of dinosaurs
we donâ€™t have specific values of `a` and `b`, so we have to use general values
that can be applied to a number of different species.

```r
get_mass_from_length_theropoda <- function(length, a, b){
  mass <- a * length ^ b
  return(mass)
}
```

Rewrite this function so that its arguments have default values of `a = 39.9` and `b = 2.6` (the average values from [Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).

1. Use this function to estimate the mass of a Sauropoda (`a = 214.44`, `b = 1.46`) that
   is 22 m long (by setting `a` and `b` when calling the function).
2. Use this function to estimate the mass of a dinosaur from an unknown taxonomic group that is 16m long.
   Only pass the function `length`, not `a` and `b`, so that the default values are used.
